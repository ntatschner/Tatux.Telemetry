# A Simple Telemetry Collection API - Written in Go(lang)

## Overview
This is a way to collect anonoised metrics about processes - PowerShell functions from a module, CI/CD Piplines or other automation sources. 
It's is currently in early stages of development, I built this to help be collect usaging information anout mu modules as a way to eusure they are functioning correctly and so I can offer imporovements. 

All the code to is shared freely, I will also link the modules i'm embedding this in to so you can maybe utalise this for yourself. 

Again, this is in the early stages and I would use any code with a pitch of salt. :)
